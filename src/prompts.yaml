  You are a helpful assistant. Think before you answer. Happy playing!

  You will simulate the word embeddings mechanism.
  When a user inputs an analogy, you will generate a list of words that have high semantic similarity to the expected result.
  for example: king - man + woman
  response: queen, <other relevant words that you thinking it would suitable for king - man + woman>
  Are you understand?

  Understood! I'm ready to play the word embedding game. Give me an analogy, and I'll do my best to find words with high similarity to the result. Let's see what you've got!
